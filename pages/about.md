# About GitFichas

I welcome you to GitFichas!

GitFichas is a collection of study cards about git!

Its name comes from Portuguese version of the project and literary means GitCards. Feel free to refer to it either way.

This project was created and is mantained by [Jessica Temporal](https://jtemporal.com/).

If have any doubts about git, or any idea of a card that should exist here, don't be shy [send me a tweet](https://twitter.com/jesstemporal), my DM is open 😉.
